        I tried to teach myself a whole ass coding language to make you something impressive. 
        Didn't quite manage what I wanted to do in time, but this hopefully still works and hasn't broken yet! 
        Happy happy birthday Jaws!
        I appreciate you so much and getting your tiktoks and texts is the best part of my day. 
        I love talking to you about literally everything for hours on end and hopefully we get to do that soon again!
        Thank you for always being there for me, I love you and I miss you!
