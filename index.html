        Fun fact: I actually learned javascript to do that fun card flippy transition. 
        It took 497 lines of javascript to do that, oof. 
        Happy happy birthday Jaws!
        I appreciate you so much and getting your tiktoks and texts is the best part of my day. 
        I love talking to you about literally everything for hours on end and hopefully we get to do that soon again!
        Thank you for always being there for me, I love you and I miss you!
