        Fun fact: I actually learned javascript to do that fun card flippy transition. 
        It took 497 lines of javascript to do that so have fun flipping back and forth haha.

        I appreciate you so much and getting your tiktoks and texts is the best part of my day. 
        I'm so lucky to have you as a friend and 
        I miss being able to spontaneously hang out and eat ramen or elotes or do facemasks or go to gay parades. 
        I love talking to you about literally everything for hours on end and hopefully we get to do that soon again!
        Thank you for always being there for me, I love you and I miss you!

        P.S There might be something coming your way on the 16th (Monday). 
        I say might because it was SUPPOSED to be there yesterday but it got delayed in like Wisconsin???
        Anyway, the tracker says Monday but I'll keep you updated. 
        Hint: I attempted to coordinate sending you meat, it didn't work out, but it goes with the gift I got you.
